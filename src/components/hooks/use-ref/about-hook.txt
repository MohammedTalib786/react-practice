// useState() = Re-renders the component when the state value changes
// useRef() = "use Reference‚Äù Does not cause re-renders when its value changes.

// ref attribute: A ref is a plain JavaScript object with a single property called current, 
// which you can read or set. You can ask React to give you a ref by calling the useRef Hook. 
// Like state, refs let you retain information between re-renders of a component. 
// Unlike state, setting the ref's current value does not trigger a re-render.

// useRef is an Object which has a current property
// 1. Accessing/Interacting with DOM elements
// 2. Handling Focus, Animations, and Transitions
// 3. Managing Timers and Intervals


// It can also be use for dynamic styling just like we do in js using .style method
